# ShellcodeLoader
**Overview**
The Shellcode Loader project demonstrates the process of loading and executing a shell in the target machine discreetly, utilizing a meticulously crafted C++ script. In conjunction with leveraging the potent Havoc C2 for post-exploitation command and control activities, the project accentuates a keen emphasis on maintaining a stealthy operational profile by employing dynamically resolved Windows API functions and AES decryption.

Security and Ethical Notice: The information and code provided in this repository are meant for educational and research purposes only. Do not use the provided code and techniques for illegal activities.
Features
Dynamic Windows API Calls: Implements dynamic resolution of critical Windows API functions to facilitate stealthy memory allocation and shellcode execution.
AES Decryption: Leverages Windows Cryptography API for decrypting AES-encrypted shellcode just before its execution, obfuscating its presence in memory and thereby mitigating certain detection vectors.
YARA Rule: A tailored YARA rule developed to identify the instances and usage of the shellcode loader by targeting strings and patterns indicative of cryptographic and memory manipulation API calls.
File Descriptions
ShellCodeLoader.cpp: Contains the C++ code for the shellcode loader, involving dynamic API call resolution, AES decryption, and shellcode execution in a newly allocated memory region. Please reference this file for a detailed code walkthrough.
ShellCodeYara.yara: A YARA rule designed to detect the presence or usage of the provided shellcode loader in analyzed files or memory, targeting API calls and characteristic strings.
How to Use
ShellCode Loader
Dependencies:
Ensure the target system has the necessary Windows libraries for API calls.
A suitable C++ compiler.
Compilation:
Compile ShellCodeLoader.cpp using a C++ compiler targeting the intended architecture (32/64 bit).
YARA Rule
Dependencies:
Install YARA: Refer to the official YARA documentation for installation and usage details.
Usage:
Utilize ShellCodeYara.yara to scan files or memory for indications of the shellcode loader using:
css
Copy code
yara -r ShellCodeYara.yara [directory or file to scan]
